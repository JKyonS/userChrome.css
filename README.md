# userChrome.css

A simple userChrome.css for Firefox.

## Demo

![pr√©via](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soraru/userChrome.css/master/pr%C3%A9via.png)

## Problems

- it has some issues with Windows
- no tests on Nightly, Aurora or Firefox Beta
- the scrollbar remover is a little bit glitchy, if you are having problems,
  just use [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/stylish/) and
  make a new script with the content of `scroll`

----

Feel free to use it as you want.
